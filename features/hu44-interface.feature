# User Story: HU-044  
# Title: Simple Interface  

Feature: Simple Interface  
    As a student  
    I want the application interface to be simple  
    So that I can navigate without difficulty  

Scenario: Clear and understandable interface  
    Given the student accesses the application  
    When navigating between different sections  
    Then the buttons, menus, and icons are displayed clearly and in an organized manner  
    And the user can easily find what they are looking for  

Scenario: Confusing or overloaded design  
    Given the student accesses the application  
    When the design contains too many elements or unnecessary information  
    Then the system simplifies the view by hiding secondary elements  
    And displays help messages or guide icons to assist the user  

Scenario: Interface adaptability  
    Given the student uses different devices (computer, tablet, or mobile)  
    When accessing the application from any of them  
    Then the interface maintains its simple and readable structure  
    And the system automatically adjusts element sizes and positions
